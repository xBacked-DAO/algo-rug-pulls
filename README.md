Look up ASAs on Algorand, and check if they could be a rug


## What is a Rug Pull?

In crypto, it is not uncommon for rogue actors to "pull the rug" on a coin or protocol.

This usually looks like them running away with a bunch of your tokens

## Rugs on Algorand

On Algorand, Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) have in built clawback and freeze mechanisms. This means if you buy tokens with a clawback or freeze, they could be retrieved from your wallet or frozen.

Moreover, smart contracts on Algorand can be updated, even after they have been audited.

This tool aims to help protect people in the Algorand ecosystem from _potential_ rugs.
